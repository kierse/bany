When starting work on Bany, I had a couple goals in mind:

0. develop a command-line utility flexible enough that it could be used to fetch transactions from any financial institution and sync them with YNAB.
0. do a deep dive into (The Clean Architecture)[https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html].

After some initial effort, I have decided to halt work. Many of the financial institutions I use personally employ measures to prevent screen scaping
and/or unauthorized API usage.
